<h1>Class Schedule</h1>

<p>
  The International Wine Guild calendar of upcoming courses is below.
</p>

<div id="calendar"></div>
<h2>Level 1 Wine Seminar or Level 1 Spirits Seminar.</h2>
<p>
  The Level 1 seminars are fundamental, beginning education. All of our courses
  begin with the
  <a href="/guild-certification-seminar">Guild Level 1 Wine Seminar</a>&nbsp;or
  the
  <a href="/level-i-guild-fine-spirits-certification-seminar">Guild Level 1 Spirits Seminar</a>. Each of our Level 1
  Seminars is a 12-hour, day and a half (Saturday-Sunday)
  seminar.&nbsp;The wine seminar is offered the first weekend of every month in
  Denver as well as other locations. Check the schedule for dates and locations.
</p>
<p>
  The Level 1 Spirits Seminar is offered 4 times a year. Check the schedule for
  dates and locations.
</p>
<h2>Level 2 Advanced Wine Course or Level 2 Advanced Fine Spirits Course</h2>
<p>
  The Level 2 courses build upon the foundation established in the Level 1 Wine
  or Spirits seminar. These are intermediate level courses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There are two ways to take the Level 2 Wine Course:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced Wine Course (11-week).</li>
  <li>Intensive Study Advanced Wine Course (6-Day).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For those that don't live in Colorado we recommend the Intensive Study
  Advanced Wine Course (6-Day). The course content, wine tasting and instruction
  are identical in the 11-Week and 6-Day courses.
</p>
<p>
  The Level 2 Advanced Fine Spirits Course is also an intermediate level course.
  &nbsp;It is available in two formats: (a0 10-Week and (b) 5-Day.
</p>
<p>To learn more about either Level 2 course go to the following hyperlinks:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Level 3 Master Courses</h2>
<p>
  Master level courses are advanced courses that are a step above the Level 2
  intermediate courses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  You can register for any of the courses, however, we recommend, but don't
  require, that you go through the Level 1 Wine Seminar first. Go to the
  following hyperlinks to learn more about our Level 3 courses.
