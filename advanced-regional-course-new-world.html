<p>This New World wine course covers countries “discovered” after 1492 because wine is a Eurocentric invention and was not consumed in any New World country until the Europeans arrived - besides the exception of the “Nouveau-New World.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>If you would like to take a detailed, technical course on New World wine you can take this course without taking anything else. However, we strongly recommend, but do not require, that you first take the Guild Level 1 Wine Seminar&nbsp;before attempting a Level 3 regional course.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Schedule&nbsp;</h3>
