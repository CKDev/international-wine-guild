  All of the Level 3 courses are available in either a 10-week format (4 hours,
  once a week) or a 5-day format (8 hours a day - Monday through Friday).
  &nbsp;Both formats teach the same material and you evaluate the same wines.
  &nbsp;We offer two formats because half our students are from out-of-state or
  out-of-country and a multi-week format won't work for them.
