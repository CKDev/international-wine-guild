<h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
<p>
  We are like a wine "college"<b>,</b> not just teaching wine tasting like it's
  a party. We provide the support and education to prepare you to become very
  knowledgable about all aspects of wine if that is your goal. For example, our
  Level II Wine Seminar is an 11-week course in which we teach how to open a
  wine bottle and wine making as well as medium-depth, that is, intermediate,
  discussions on 15 countries and wine evaluation of about 50 wines. At Level 3,
  Advanced or Master level courses, we provide in-depth advanced education about
  wine, wine history, climate, terroir and, of course, wine evaluation (advanced
  wine tasting).
</p>
<p>
  We understand that there are enthusiasts with a passion for wine, as well as
  wine and food. Therefore, we provide advanced quality, in-depth, factual
  courses<b>.</b>
</p>
<p>
  All of our lead instructors have industry experience – often in a range of
  different parts of the industry. Many have career changed into the industry
  and have a full understanding of how to instruct everybody, regardless of you
  experience or background.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  All of our instructors have been through a two-year training program to. They
  teach to a curriculum in each seminar or course.
</p>
<p>
  Because the wine industry changes at such a rapid pace, we have developed all
  of the full-color materials we use in our seminars and courses so you can be
  up-to-date with everything you are learning. In addition, we have developed a
  series of <strong>proprietary tools</strong> that students receive as part of
  their materials for each class. (student materials are included in your
  registration fees.) These materials are updated annually to stay on top of a
  fast changing industry.
</p>
<p>
  We pour premium quality wines in each seminar and course. Many people who
  teach wine classes only use one distributor, or have a goal of selling wine as
  part of the class. We work with all distributors and do not cut corners by
  serving mediocre or poor quality wine. We are a wine school and do not sell
  wine as part of our instruction.
</p>
<p>
  As our tagline says, our goal is to offer you “a lifetime of wine and spirits
  education.”
