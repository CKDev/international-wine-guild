<h2>Blind Tasting Course</h2>
<br>
<p class="clear clearfix">To be a true wine expert, you must develop objectivity in wine evaluation.</p>
<p>This course trains for double-blind evaluations (where the taster knows absolutely nothing about the wine before it
    is poured). Tasting a wine blind and then evaluating its quality and value is one of the best ways to establish an
    unbiased opinion about wine!</p>
<p>There is an art and science behind blind wine tasting and evaluation, which is essential to honing tasting skills and
    developing your personal tasting style.&nbsp;</p>
