Tynan's International Wine Guild site.

## TODO

The includes on default layout shouldn't go on the homepage
Check the woofu forms

## Notes

The link on /frequently-asked-questions to "PDF copy of our program brief." is broken on the old site. (/2015%20Program%20Brief%20Ver2%20Web.pdf)

The first paragraph on intro-to-wine... "Related Wine Courses Tags: Wine Courses Sommelier Courses" just goes to the
site root.
