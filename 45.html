<p>Wine Faults begins by covering the difference between flaws and faults, how flavors develop, and how taste and smell work in the evaluation of wine. This book also tackles faults arising from various wine making methods, including the increasing problems resulting from high alcohol wines; volatile acidity in high pH wines common in some warm grape-growing regions; and vegetal qualities of cool viticultural regions. The book is written in a manner that both the layperson and the quality control professional can understand. </p>

<p>Wine tasters, whether they are students, teachers, winemakers, sommeliers or consumers, need to be able to recognize and evaluate faults in wine. There is enough depth and detail to be immensely useful to wine instructors and pupils while avoiding an overload of minutiae.</p><p></p>
