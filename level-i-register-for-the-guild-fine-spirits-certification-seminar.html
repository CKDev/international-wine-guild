<p><strong>If for any reason a class is canceled we will phone or e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the class.
    If a class is canceled at the last minute due to bad weather (this is very rare) we will reschedule the class.
    However, if a class is held and you decide not to attend because you believe the weather is bad than it will be
    treated as a no-show. It is highly recommended that you register early, your credit card will not be charged until
    seven days in advance of the course. We must have a minimum students registered in order to form a course. If you
    are traveling from out of town to attend, please do not make arrangements until two weeks in advance of the
    course.</strong></p>
