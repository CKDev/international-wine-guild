<p><b><b><strong>If for any reason a class is canceled we will phone or e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the
        class. If a class is canceled at the last minute due to bad weather (this is very rare) we will reschedule the

        will be treated as a no-show. It is highly recommended that you register early, your credit card will not be
        charged until seven days in advance of the course. We must have a minimum students registered in order to form
        a course. If you are traveling from out of town to attend, please do not make arrangements until two weeks in
        advance of the course.</strong></b></b><b><b><strong>&nbsp;</strong></b></b></p>
