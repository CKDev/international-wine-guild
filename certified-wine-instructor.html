  through the <a href="http://www.internationalwineguild.com">wine school</a>. The goal is to develop individuals who
  have the desire, teaching capability, presentation skills, and appropriate attitude to successfully teach others
  about wine.</p>
<p>Prerequisites are the Advanced Wine Course and the Advanced Wine &amp; Food Pairing Course for the CWI Diploma
  program.</p>
<p>This course is designed to develop the skills to teach a college or trade school level introductory class on wine.
  This course was designed by MWI's as well as Guild Instructors with Master's Degrees in Education.</p>
<p>The Guild has members who are experts at course development, test writing, and all aspects of teaching.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the Certified Wine Instructor course you can study to become a Senior Wine Instructor and

<p><strong>If for any reason a class is canceled we will phone or e-mail you 48 hours prior to the start of the class.
    If a class is canceled at the last minute due to bad weather (this is very rare) we will reschedule the class.
    However, if a class is held and you decide not to attend because you believe the weather is bad than it will be
    treated as a no-show. It is highly recommended that you register early, your credit card will not be charged until
    seven days in advance of the course. We must have a minimum students registered in order to form a course. If you
    are traveling from out of town to attend, please do not make arrangements until two weeks in advance of the
