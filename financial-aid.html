<h2>Payment Plan</h2>
<p>
  The Guild has a payment plan program. We can set up a program whereby you can
  pay for any seminar or course in two or three payments.
</p>
<p>
  For any seminar or courses you take on a payment plan, you should have paid
  for it by the time it starts. If you have any questions or would like to
  discuss payment plan options please contact Sherrie at 303-296-3966 or&nbsp;<a
