ISBN:1-891267-63-9. 3rd edition. 2003</strong></p>

<p>This book offers a concise history of port and port trade as it has developed over the past three-hundred years, with descriptions of the soil and climate, the species of vine, the cycle of work in the vineyards and the wine “lodges” where it matures before being shipped to its world-wide markets.</p>

<p>This new edition covers the advent of the many new single Quinta ports, the technological advances and notes on the most recent vintages, as well changes in the ownership of the major growers and shippers.</p>

<p>Written in a pleasant, anecdotal style, this book conveys a wealth of valuable up-to-date information of interest to the lover of wine, food and travel.</p><p></p>
