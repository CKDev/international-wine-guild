<p class="clear clearfix"></p><p><strong>Concepts in Wine Technology by Yair Margalit, Ph.D.<br>
ISBN: 1-891267-51-1. 2004</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the International Wine Guild’s textbooks for our Advanced Wine Students.</p>

<p>This is a “how-to-book” organized in the sequence of the processes a winemaker faces when the grapes arrive at the winery.  For “pre-harvest” to “bottling”, this is a thorough and logical handbook for wine production with emphasis on practical and applied science.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about making wine, this is a great resource and a “must read” book.</p><p></p>
