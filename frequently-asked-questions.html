<h3>
  What Is The International Wine Guild<a style="text-decoration: none;" name="1"
    >&nbsp;</a
  >
</h3>
<p>
  The International Wine Guild is a wine vocational school, approved in the
  State of Colorado, to offer diploma programs and professional certifications
  for professionals in the wine industry and serious enthusiasts who would like
  to learn about wine like a professional. The Guild offers technical (Level I -
  III) diploma and certification programs, as well as Wine Educator and Wine
  Judge diploma and certification programs.
</p>
<p>
  College level wine education is a fairly new concept. There have been enology
  and viticulture programs for decades, but if you want to study and learn about
  wine, not how to make or grow it, there are very few options.
</p>
<p>
  The Guild is very proud to be one of the very few stand-alone wine colleges in
  the United States. We are not part of a culinary school or hotel and
  restaurant management program - we provide college level wine education
  through 25 different professional wine courses.
</p>
<h3>

<h3>
  Are IWG awards recognized in other states and countries.<a
    style="text-decoration: none;"
    name="3"
    >&nbsp;</a
  >
</h3>
<p>
  IWG awards are recognized throughout the United States and many other
  countries. The Guild has graduates living in all 50 states and 25 foreign
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  The IWG is currently providing wine education in China, at the request of the
  Chinese government. The Guild was approached by a Chinese governmental agency,
  the Hangzhou Wine Cultural Center, to help establish wine education throughout
  the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC).
</p>
<p>
  The Guild is also working with Malaysia and Singapore to establish wine
  education programs in those countries as well.
</p>
<h3>
  What level of education do I need to start taking classes from the Guild?<a
    style="text-decoration: none;"
    name="4"
    >&nbsp;</a
  >
</h3>
<p>
  There are no requirements. International students must pass an English
  proficiency exam (offered by others).
</p>
<h3>
  Do we teach our programs in other states besides Colorado, Texas and
  Arizona?<a style="text-decoration: none;" name="5">&nbsp;</a>
</h3>
<p>
  If you are interested in the Guild coming to your state or city to teach a
  Level 1 or Level 2 course. &nbsp;Please contact us a
  info@internationalwineguild.com.
</p>
<h3>
  How long are your programs?<a style="text-decoration: none;" name="6"
    >&nbsp;</a
  >
</h3>
<p>
  The Guild offers nine distinct programs. Four are technical, three are for
  wine educators and two for wine judges.
</p>
<p>
  Our technical diploma programs include our Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3
  seminars and courses. The Level 1 seminar is a 1-and-one-half seminar that
  provides a foundation to prepare you for Level 2 or 3 courses. We offer two
  Level 1 seminars: (1) a Wine Seminar and (2) a Fine Spirits Seminar.
</p>
<p>
  The Level 2 Courses, the Advanced Wine Course or the Advanced Fine Spirits
  Course, are 48 contact hours, which can be taken as a 11-week course or a
  6-day intensive study course.
</p>
<p>
  The Level 3 Courses are part of the Guild Wine Master program. It is a
  prestigious program that requires you to complete at least 7 different Level 3
  courses as well as master exams associated with each course for a Level 3
  award. Most students require 9 to 15 months to complete this program. We have
  had people go from zero education to a Level 3 award in 15 months. However,
  all of our Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 courses can be taken for
  personal-enrichment and don't require you taking an exam.
</p>
<p>
  The Guild Wine Instructor and Senior Wine Instructor awards are each 12-week
  or 1-week intensive study courses.. If you are interested in teaching Guild
  seminars and courses in your city contact the Guild at
  info@internationalwineguild.com.
</p>
<p>
  Our Guld Wine Judge and Competition Wine Judge awards are one-day short
  courses for those that have completed at least 4 Level 3 courses.

  I took a wine course in college and want to continue my education with the
  Guild. Where do I begin?<a style="text-decoration: none;" name="10">&nbsp;</a>
</h3>
<p>
  If you completed a college level wine course, and received a B or higher
  grade, send the Guild a copy of your official transcript. Verification that
  you completed the course with a B or higher allows you can begin your
  education with the
  <a href="/advanced-wine-course">Advanced Wine Course (Level 2)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This would include a wine course, or beverage course, from an approved
  Culinary school as well.

  <a href="/guild-certification-seminar">Guild Wine Seminar (Level 1) </a>
