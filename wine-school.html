<p>Swirling wine in the glass opens it and allows your senses to take note of how the wine smells. Sniff the bouquet
  up into your nose, concentrate on the berries, nuts and other flavors you are experiencing before taking that
  initial sip. Using all of your senses to enjoy, learn about and appreciate is the goal and purpose of wine study.

    courses</a> and <a href="/">wine classes</a> are taking it
  to a professional
  level. Your preferences and subtle responses to smell and taste will refine as you learn. When you experience wine,
  you’ll learn to pay close attention not only to flavor, but also how the wine feels, its temperature, and weight.
  Your observations will refine over time with valuable education through wine classes and <a href="/">sommelier
    school</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond swirl, sniff, and sip, familiarizing yourself with common wine terminology will help you on your way.</p>
