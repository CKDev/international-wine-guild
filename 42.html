<p class="clear clearfix">These charts show the relationship of different wines to each other
with respect to body (light to full) and dryness (very dry to very
sweet). This allows you to visualize general characteristics of a
specific wine (for example, a typical AoC Pauillac) or type (a typical
Champagne Demi-Sec). <br><br>
These charts are great to help figure out the correct order of tasting
wine as well as help with wine and food pairing. They also are good
training tools to learn blind tasting. Each chart shows approximately
50-100 key wines from a country or region. There are color charts
available for France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal (including
fortified wines) and the New World. Complete instructions on how to use
a chart are included.
<br><br>Depending upon the wines produced in a specific country a
chart could have entries for white, rosé, red, sparkling, late harvest
dessert wines, as well as white and red fortified wines. <br><br>
These charts are an excellent method to learn about such things as the
order of serving wine, wine and food pairing, blind tasting and the
relationship between different wines produced in a specific region or
country. Charts are available in two sizes: 13x19 and 11x17 (in
inches). Each chart is for a specific country and contains information
about key wines produced in that country.</p>
