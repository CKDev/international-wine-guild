  For years we have wanted to do wine dinners that were special and unique and
  for anybody who really appreciates fine wine and food. This is it! Each dinner
  includes at least 4 courses and a minimum of 6 different wines.
</p>
<p><strong>What's Special about our Dinners?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    They are NOT winery dinners, where all the wine comes from one producer.
    Each wine has been carefully selected to pair with a specific course.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Most are classic regional dinners where you get an opportunity to taste some
    of the world's most famous wine and food combinations.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Menus and wine pairings are designed by Claude Robbins, MWA and President of
    the International Wine &amp; Spirits Guild, so the wines are brought in
    <em>especially</em> for the dinner.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Each dinner includes a brief talk between courses of how the wines and foods
    were chosen and a little history behind the pairings.<br />
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Meet others in the food and wine industry and/or others who share your
    interest in wine and food.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What to Expect:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
  All dinners begin with a time to meet and greet, usually with a sparkling wine
  or other aperitif.
</p>
<p>
  Dining is European seating, dress is business casual. You must make your
  reservation through the Guild by clicking a corresponding "Register" link
  above to sign up.

  as arrangements can often be made to accommodate your needs if given at least
  2 weeks advanced notice.
</p>
<p><strong>Reservations:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
  Reservations are on a first come, first serve basis. Reservations usually
  close 5 business days before a dinner. Click a corresponding "Register" link
  above to sign up. Registration fees include food, wine, and tax.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Because we guarantee events based on the number of registrants, no-shows are
  charged a non-refundable fee equal to the registration fee, per person, unless
  other arrangements are made at least 5 working days in advance of the dinner.
